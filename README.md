- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SJHs-GitHub
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m primarily interested in machine learning, along with other AI methods, as well as the development of apps in languages like Java and Python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, as it will benefit my skillset to know this language. I'm always learning more about machine learning and AI, looking to gain both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.
- This github is a store for my completed projects.
- I hope you're having a great day!
