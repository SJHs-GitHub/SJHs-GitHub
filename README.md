- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SJHs-GitHub
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m primarily interested in machine learning, along with other AI methods, as well as the development of apps in languages like Java and Python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, as it will benefit my skillset to know this language. I'm always learning more about machine learning and AI, looking to gain both theoretical and practical skills.
- This github will double as a store for both completed projects and projects that are still in development. Only completed projects will be available for public viewing.
- This is not my collaborative-working github, but a storage github for my personal projects.
- I hope you're having a great day!
