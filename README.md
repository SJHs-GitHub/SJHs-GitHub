- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sam!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m primarily interested in machine learning, along with other AI methods, as well as the development of programs in languages like Java and Python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, as I believe it will benefit my skillset to know this language. I'm always learning more about machine learning and AI, looking to gain both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.
- The public repositories contain some of my completed school and university projects.
- Please feel free to have a look through them.
- I hope you're having a great day.
